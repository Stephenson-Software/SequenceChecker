# Problem Statement
Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

# Subsequence Definition
A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that arenâ€™t necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. Ex. [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4]
